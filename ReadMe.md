## Welcome to the Walkthrough Handbook

Throughout this page you‚Äôll be able to see and read through all of the publicly available documentation we have on the company. We do this because:

1. By sharing openly, we often receive feedback and make our processes better.
2. Prospective candidates can look through how our company is run to see if they‚Äôd fit within our culture.
3. We help other people build great companies by replicating & modifying our documentation.

See at the bottom of this wiki about contributing. We'd love & welcome your suggestions!
