# Welcome to Walkthrough! :wave:
Joining a new team can be one of the most stressful times of a new team member’s journey in joining a new company. Often times they are stressed about performing well and setting a good example, not knowing what to do, and have enough insight into what their first week will be like. The goal is to have them contribute to the company as soon as possible - even during the first day. For those reasons, we’ve tried outlining what your first week looks like at Walkthrough, well before you join. 

 
## Before your first day

1. First and foremost, take the time to review & sign the contract agreement that was sent to you over email & docusign. If you have any questions, definiltely don’t be afraid to reach out to pascal@getawalkthrough.com.

1.  Signup for slack and add your photo to your profile so we know who we’re talking to!  Be sure to enter your phone number and email to make it easy for other team members to reach out to you, if needed.

	1. Be sure to set up your notifications properly by following our [Slack onboarding guide](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/InternalHandbook/blob/master/SlackOnboarding.md)


1. Sign up for [SpaceTime](https://getawalkthrough.spacetime.am/signup) so that we understand where in the world you are and when we can *generally* expect to see you online.

1. Sign up on [LastPass](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/InternalHandbook/blob/master/LastpassTeam.md) so that we’re able to give you all of the login credentials you’ll need to get up & running!

1.  Book two 1-1 calls with CEO. One for the end of your first day & one at the end of the day of your first week! You can do that here: www.meetme.so/pascal.

1. Read through our [company values](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/Values.md) so you can get a better idea of how we operate as a company. 

1. Next to values comes our [“Operating Principles”](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/HowWeWork/OperatingPrinciples.md). At Walkthrough, you are given autonomy in regards to when you work & how you work and so we aim to give you “Principles” to help guide your decision making. We try to weave these principles into every part of Walkthrough whether that’s in deciding who to hire or how this may influence our values & day to day actions. 

1. You may also want to take a quick peak at the [general company information](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/GeneralAdminInfo.md) which includes our company contact information as well as every social profile that we have!

1. Before your first day you might want to have a better understanding of who does what on the team and what their roles’ expectations are. You can find an entire breakdown of that with our [team breakdown & org chart](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/Team.md).

1. We've outlined what equity compensation looks like, why we have it, and what it means to you. [All of that is broken down here.](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/HowWeWork/ExplainingEquity.md)

1. We've added several videos for you to watch and become familiar with all of Walkthrough's existing processes and procedures so that understand what systems we have internally here. [Those videos are accessible here](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/InternalHandbook/blob/master/WalkthroughSystemsOverview.md) if you have access to our private github repositories. 

1. And lastly, before you attend your first team meeting, you may want to get a better understanding of what meetings we have, how often they are, and what they usually entail. You can find all of that information [here.](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/HowWeWork/CompanyMeetings.md)
	1. As a side note, you should have already received a calendar invitation to all of the meetings above. If you haven’t, be sure to email pascal@getawalkthrough.com and he’ll be sure to add you to each scheduled meeting!
