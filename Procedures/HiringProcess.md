# Walkthrough Hiring Process
We’ve outlined our hiring process to not only give candidates the ins and outs to know what we’re looking for but to also give our team a standard process for understanding which candidates would be the best fit for our organization.

## Metrics

We’re still in the early days of evaluating our entire hiring funnel but metrics we’re aiming to track are:

- Number of people who make it through the funnel by source
- Number of people who make it through the funnel by position
- Number of days between application & hire

These will be updated as soon as we’re able to get this data together!

<br><br>
## 1) Initial Survey Submission

The key cultural values we’re looking to evaluate are:

- When looking at their social profiles, are they generally positive and optimistic?
- Are they into self/professional development and trying to become the best version of themselves?
	- As one of our board members [Mike Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-klein-5506b31b/) has mentioned, “it’s not about what they learned but rather do they have the innate desire to be better - like parents who read baby books are better parents because of the curiosity.”
- Have they been in a similar role for most of their career (Not a designer here, engineer there. We want X years of experience from job to job).  

Today, the questions we ask via google form are:

- What is your first name?
- What is your last name?
- What is your email (So we can contact you)?
- What is your phone number?
- What city & country do you currently live in?
- What role are you applying for?
- Where did you find this job posting?
- What is your Linkedin (we look at this instead of Resumes)?
- What is your facebook URL?
- What is your twitter URL?
- What is your Github/Dribbble URL?
- Do you have any additional website/blog/portfolio?
- What additional materials, if any, can we provide you upfront to help you decide if applying is worth your time?
- What are the last 5 books you read and why?


<br><br>
## 2) Longer Written Submission
Throughout this next part of the process, we're trying to gauge 3 things:

1. How you communicate in the written format (we’re remote so this is our main method of communication)
1. Understand how you think 
1. Are we in alignment on how to solve problems.   

Below are a few questions that shouldn’t take you longer than 30 minutes to write. If after reading through the responses, we think we’re on the same page, we’ll hop on a video call together. 

Here are the questions we ask you over email:

1. How would you prioritize these upcoming integrations and why?
	1. Building a phone application for realtors to streamline ordering, 
	1. Improve on our photographer phone application to reduce errors by photographers, 
	1. Build a self-onboarding photographer funnel so we eliminate interviews and training overhead)
1. What are you looking for at Walkthrough that your current company does not provide?
1.  What is your 2 favorite API documentations and/or UX/UI case studies and why? (Please include a link)
1. If you were to relate to at least 2 brands that you like, what are those brands and why? (e.g. I most relate to Apple because of their desire to build the best product that is designed with the user in mind throughout the entire process. I most relate to Buffer for their never ending quest for bettering themselves and their transparency. I like that because…)
1.  What are 3 technical questions that we should ask you in the video interview that would allow us to get a great understanding of your expertise and how you might have a deeper level of knowledge than other candidates?  


<br><br>
## 3) First Cultural Interview
The idea of the first interview is to understand if we’re an initial fit. We may not cover every question but we should both walk away from the conversation thinking *“Yes - I’d love to continue talking to this company/candidate.”*

From our perspective, throughout the first interview the key things we’re looking to evaluate are:

- Did we struggle carrying the conversation or was it very natural?
- How hungry are they? Is this just another job or are they really engaged, trying to read as much as they can?
- Do they want to be apart of a company with a high growth trajectory? Are they looking for stability in one particular role? Are they looking at how much they could grow personally or professionally?
- Is this person innately curious and trying to become a better person? Constantly trying to learn, are humble enough to know they can constantly improve?
- Do they think about work in their off-time as a hobby? (Contribute to Github on personal projects, Dribbble as redesigns, etc)
- Does this person eat/sleep/breath their profession?  


The questions we ask in the first interview in no particular order are:

- Can you start by giving me a quick summary of you? Personally & Professionally?
- How did you prepare for this interview?
- What attracted you to this role?
- Why are you looking to make a switch now vs 6 months ago?
- What are the next 3 books you’re looking to read?
- What book would you recommend everyone in our startup read & why?
- How are you deciding between companies to work with?
- What does success look like for you in this role? What do you think would make you feel happy or fulfilled working here for the next several years?  
- What do you think working in a startup means? Give me examples of what a typical day would be like at start up in the past.  
- What hours do you enjoy working?

Additionally, we're paying attention to the questions that *you ask*. We learn more about a candidate and their questions than the ones we ask because we understand more of what is important to them. If someone comes to an interview and only has  a few questions, that's a red flag. Don’t have questions to ask - google a few and you’ll realize what you should be asking us. That being said, be sure you’re not asking a question that is already addressed in this handbook.

<br><br>
## 4) Homework
The next piece of the interview process is to really understand your ability to look at our company and identify what are quick adjustments that can be made that will build momentum within our organization. For this homework task, we'd love for you to identify 10 things on our website, application, or anything else that you'd make an adjustment to.

<br><br>
## 5) Follow Up Cultural Interview
The idea of the second interview is more of an extension of our first call. Here we may cover the questions we missed in our first interaction and we should be covering additional questions each other have. Additional questions we may ask are:

- What do you like to do when you are not working?
- What are you looking for in a new position?
- Why are you leaving your current job?
- What other companies are you interviewing with and what makes them intriguing?
- What are a few things you really enjoy at your current company and what would you change?
- Are you a "move fast, break things" or a "let's do this right the first time" kind of person?
- At work what types of activities do you find fulfilling. At work what are objectives or activities that you get excited over And why?
- Talk to me about your teenage years - what was it like? Did you work hard when you were a teenager? Give an example.


<br><br>
## 6) Technical Challenge/Interview
More to be added

<br><br>
## 7) Lightning Talk
Throughout the lightning talk, the key things we’re looking to evaluate are:

- Do they pull the energy out of the room or do they add to it?
- Are they able to teach the rest of the team something new?
- Do we feel as if they are raising the expertise level of the team?
- Does the existing team enjoy interacting with them?


#### What makes a good lightning talk:
- Deep expertise:
	- You look intelligent if we all walk away from the talk thinking, wow, I didn’t know that. Telling us what design is - makes you look like a beginner. Telling us use cases for design that we’ve never thought of before - that makes you look like you know the ins & outs of design.  

#### Things to avoid during your talk:

- Reading from your screen:
	- Your slides should help convey your points, not be used to keep you on track.   
- Presenting for more than 5 minutes:
	- The lightning talk is designed for us to interact with you. When you take 10-20 minutes it not only shows that you weren’t prepared and didn’t plan well, but it also doesn’t let us talk to you.   
- Filler words:
	- This makes us believe that you don’t know what you’re talking about. We’re a remote company and we can’t see your body language. Using filler words doesn’t display confidence so be sure that you know your topic well. 

#### Just to get your mind going, here are a couple ideas as examples:

- The pros & cons of using Python over PHP.
- How Apple & Slack vary in their design process and why it works for them.
- The underlying reasons why people or companies who do X are more successful.


<br><br>
## 8) Independent Contract Period (4-8 weeks)
If things have gone well up to this point in the process we like to give both of us a chance to know each other better by entering into an independent contract period. During this time you'll attend all of our meetings and be integrated into our development process similar to a full team member. This period can be started part-time with the expectation that the 4 week contract period will begin once you're able to switch over full time. Occasionally we ask individuals to extend the contract period beyond the 4 weeks if we feel like we still don't have enough data to determine if the role is the right fit.

Overall the goal for this independent contract period is to ensure that you are fully capable of performing the duties and responsibilities of the role you are applying for, to see how effectively you are able to collaborate with the other members of the team, and to make sure that your are excited and energized by the Walkthrough culture. Here are some things that we are looking to see during this period:

- Are you able to take small tasks, and operating mostly independently, deliver quality work in a timely manner.

- Are you asking lots of questions, which is a sign to us that you are deeply engaged. Within your first week you should be curious and consistently asking questions like, "Why are we doing things this way?".

- Within your first week, have you identified some quick wins and executed on them. Whether it's clarifying the wording in a section of our onboarding documents, or correcting a few small bugs you found in the backlog, we expect everyone to find small things that can be iterated and improved upon in their first few days.

- Are you collaborating effectively with the rest of the team. Are you asking for help where it makes sense, are you responding well to feedback from other members of the team, do you go out of your way to be helpful, and can you leverage the strengths of the extended team to deliver a more compelling end result.

- Are you proactive in taking on tasks, and demonstrating ownership for those tasks for which you are responsible. Whether that is leading and being responsible for one of our weekly growth initiatives, or taking point on a particular issue in a sprint, we are interested in seeing how you handle leading the charge to get something done.

- Are you communicating effectively with the rest of the team, both in meetings and in other written communications. Are you able to communicate your needs, opinions and thoughts in a clear and concise manner, and are you always respectful to other team members even in situations when you may disagree.

Throughout this independent contract period, we will be meeting with you weekly to make sure that you have what you need to execute successfully, to give you feedback on your performance, and to check-in to see how you are feeling about your fit in the role and with Walkthrough as a company.


<br><br>
## 9) Full Time Offer
Throughout the entire independent contract period, you will have a very clear idea of how things are going based on your experience and our feedback. Once we've all agreed it's a great fit and want to move forward, you will be presented with a offer for full time employment. You will have the option to choose your compensation package - whether you would rather have more salary, or more equity. All of the compensation options are outlined in detail [here.](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/HowWeWork/CompensationStructure.md) You will also be eligible for all of our standard employee benefits.

All of our full time employees are expected to do photography shoot & customer support at least once a year, regardless of position. We believe an early and ongoing connection with the people we serve and better understanding our teammates roles will help build a great organization and product. These are activities that we will schedule as part of your onboarding process.

<br><br>
## What is not taken into account throughout the interview process as of now:
- Role specific interviews
- Potentially adding personality tests (DISC, Enneagram, Myers Briggs, etc)
- When do we review the financial model w/ candidates & does that have an impact in the hiring process?
- How do we, if at all, gauge their ability to work remotely?
- Being more clear about exact compensation someone may receive when joining Walkthrough before applying.
- There is no formal process for reference checks. We have done them in the past for specific candidates but may not happen every time.
