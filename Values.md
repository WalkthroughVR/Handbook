## Defining Walkthrough's Values
When we think about culture, we ask ourselves:<br>
“What environment would enable Walkthrough to become one of the world’s greatest brands - creating the best products, ensuring happiness for our users, and creating the most fulfillment and personal growth for our team?”

The following values are what we’ve come up with to date, that we believe in and strive for. They happen to spell out what we personally all strive for - GROWTH.


1.  **Growth**
    1. Details:
        1. Are conscious of your current level of productivity and happiness and make continual adjustments to improve your life.
        2. Have a higher expectation of yourself than Walkthrough does of you
        3. Practice activities or develop habits that will improve your mind and body
    2. In Practice:
        1. Are potential hires actively reading books to better their understanding of the world? Are they naturally curious? We actively sort for candidates who read!
        1. We give free books on kindle & audible to all of our team members to encourage their self development & growth to become better people. 

2. **(Doing the) right thing**
    1. Details:
        1. Choose whats best for customers and the company in the long-term
        1. Correct mistakes even when no one would notice
        1. Get excited about opportunities to help others

    2. In Practice:
        1. One of our photographers had their shoes stolen while working at a property as the homeowner asked them to take them off and leave them outside. We chose to pay for a new set of shoes for them.

3. **Optimism**
    1. Details:
        1. Strive to approach things in a positive and optimistic way
        2. Avoid criticizing or condemning team members or users
        3. Avoid complaining
        4. Let the other person save face, even if they are clearly wrong
        5. Are deliberate about giving genuine appreciation
    2. In Practice:
        1. On Facebook & Twitter, are you posting mostly positive comments or are you often complaining?
        2. We aim not to clown people in front of their peers. While it’s OK to give certain kinds of feedback in a group setting, you should strive never to embarrass someone in front of their peers. If you do so, then your feedback will have little impact other than to a) cause the employee to be horribly ashamed and b) cause the employee to hate your guts

4. **Weighing Data**
    1. Details:
        1. Take the approach that everything is a hypothesis and you could be wrong
        2. Are suggestive rather than instructive, replacing phrases such as ‘certainly’, ‘undoubtedly’, etc. with ‘perhaps’, ‘I think’, ‘my intuition says’
     2. In Practice:
        1. In every meeting we refer back to a metric. It's easy in meetings to jump ahead to designing a solution before fully understanding the problem or understanding how much we want to improve a metric by to help determine if our solution is a success or not. 
        1. When prioritizing product road map, we've looked at the metrics we're aiming to improve that quarter and adjust our roadmap based on what we believe will have the biggest impact on those metrics. 
        
5. **Transparency**
    1. Details:
        1. Share beliefs, failures, strengths and decisions
        2. Use transparency to build trust and to help others
        3. State your thoughts immediately and with honesty
        4. Over-communicate, repeating things more times than you would intuitively
        5. Don’t make assumptions, you instead ask that extra question to have the full picture
    2. In Practice:
        1. We've written down and share our [product roadmap publicly](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/projects/2) to make sure that everyone on the team is on the same page, customers can get an idea of what we're working on and potential applicants can get better insight into the projects they may jump into.

6. **Hustle**
    1. Details:
        1. Are comfortable making decisions and working in situations of uncertainty
        2. Have a bias towards actions. Done well today is better than perfect next week
        3. Desire to create a great product!!!
