# Walkthrough's Values
Below you'll find how we define our culture. Values are the ideals that we aim for every person to grow towards and uphold. These are intended to define the type of "Mindset" we're looking for within each team member at Walkthrough. 
<br><br>
When we think about culture, we ask ourselves: “What environment would enable Walkthrough to become one of the world’s greatest brands - creating the best products, ensuring happiness for our users, and creating the most fulfillment and personal growth for our team?”

The following values are what we’ve come up with to date, that we believe in and strive for.

## Cultivate Positivity
We do our best to always approach situations with a positive and optimistic mindset. We assume positive intent on the behalf of coworkers, customers, and anyone else we may be working with. We strive to be happy and to seek out solutions, not problems. We avoid complaining or criticizing teammates unnecessarily and are deliberate about sharing genuine appreciation on a regular basis.

## Default to Transparency
We believe that transparency is the foundation on which trust is built, and that trust is a prerequisite to building a high-performance team. We share our thoughts openly and honestly, we highlight our successes and our failures, our strengths and our weaknesses. We use radical candor to deliver direct feedback while ensuring individuals know how much we care about them. We avoid making assumptions and don’t let serious concerns go unaddressed.

## Leverage Data
Whenever possible we seek out data to test our hypotheses and assist us in making decisions. We delegate decisions to the individuals who are in the best position and have the necessary data to make an informed decision. At the same time, we have a bias towards action and work to avoid “analysis paralysis”. We endeavor to leverage data to help us overcome our personal biases and avoid blind spots as a company.

## Honor Commitments
We take the commitments we make to our teammates seriously and do our best to either deliver on those commitments or clearly communicate as soon as we realize we will not be able to meet one. We take pride in creating a great product and correct mistakes even when no one will notice. We work through uncertainty and are willing to put in the extra effort to make sure things are done right.

## Improve Consistently
As individuals, and as a company, we consistently find ways to improve. We actively seek out opportunities to discover new ideas, ways to collaborate, and approaches to problem-solving. We don’t try to avoid mistakes; instead, we focus on learning and strive for excellence. On a personal level, we identify activities that bring balance to our lives and work to build habits that will improve our minds and our bodies.

These core values have been influenced by many different individuals and companies, but we specifically want to say thank you to Buffer and Basecamp for being so transparent with their own core values (from which we borrowed liberally), and to Kim Scott the author of Radical Candor and David Marquet the author of Turn The Ship Around (whose ideas are found throughout the descriptions of these values).
