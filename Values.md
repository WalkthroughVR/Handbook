# Walkthrough's Values
Below you'll find how we define our culture. Values are the ideals that we aim for every person to grow towards and uphold. These are intended to define the type of "Mindset" we're looking for within each team member at Walkthrough. 
<br><br>
When we think about culture, we ask ourselves: “What environment would enable Walkthrough to become one of the world’s greatest brands - creating the best products, ensuring happiness for our users, and creating the most fulfillment and personal growth for our team?”

The following values are what we’ve come up with to date, that we believe in and strive for. They happen to spell out what we personally all strive for - GROWTH.


## Growth
**Details:**
* Are conscious of your current level of productivity and happiness and make continual adjustments to improve your life.
* Have a higher expectation of yourself than Walkthrough does of you
* Practice activities or develop habits that will improve your mind and body

**In Practice:**
* Are potential hires actively reading books to better their understanding of the world? Are they naturally curious? We actively sort for candidates who read!
* We give free books on kindle & audible to all of our team members to encourage their self development & growth to become better people. 
* We are not firefighters (although we need to do this from time to time). We are architects. We don’t manage problems; we work on systems in order to prevent problems from happening in the first place. We simplify. Many times eliminating of a system, protocol, or project can be a good thing. We refine to the smallest amount of steps. Our systems are designed to be “Off-The-Street” meaning, anyone with the required skills for a role could pick up a procedure and follow it. 

## (Doing the) right thing
**Details:**'
* Choose whats best for customers and the company in the long-term
* Correct mistakes even when no one would notice
* Get excited about opportunities to help others

**In Practice:**
* One of our photographers had their shoes stolen while working at a property as the homeowner asked them to take them off and leave them outside. We chose to pay for a new set of shoes for them.
* If your system failed or you didn’t follow procedure, you step in and do what it takes to right the wrong as quickly as possible.
* We don’t waste anyone else’s time. Whether that’s attending meetings late or delivering late. We value and respect each others time. 
* When we have wronged a customer, always give them the choice of choosing at least two different options to make it right.  We come up with the choices, but empower the customer to make the decision. They are our livelihood, without them we don’t earn an income. We do whatever it takes (up to $200) to make a customer happy. Whether that is find another company to provide the service for them, give a refund, or to switch things around to make their desires happen. 

## Optimism
**Details:**
* Strive to approach things in a positive and optimistic way
* Avoid criticizing or condemning team members or users
* Avoid complaining
* Let the other person save face, even if they are clearly wrong
* Are deliberate about giving genuine appreciation

**In Practice:**
* On Facebook & Twitter, are you posting mostly positive comments or are you often complaining?
* We aim not to clown people in front of their peers. While it’s OK to give certain kinds of feedback in a group setting, you should strive never to embarrass someone in front of their peers. If you do so, then your feedback will have little impact other than to a) cause the employee to be horribly ashamed and b) cause the employee to hate your guts

## Weighing Data
**Details:**
* Take the approach that everything is a hypothesis and you could be wrong
* Are suggestive rather than instructive, replacing phrases such as ‘certainly’, ‘undoubtedly’, etc. with ‘perhaps’, ‘I think’, ‘my intuition says’

**In Practice:**
* In every meeting we refer back to a metric. It's easy in meetings to jump ahead to designing a solution before fully understanding the problem or understanding how much we want to improve a metric by to help determine if our solution is a success or not. 
* When prioritizing product road map, we've looked at the metrics we're aiming to improve that quarter and adjust our roadmap based on what we believe will have the biggest impact on those metrics. 
* There are a lot of opinions about what does and doesn't work. Suggestions and recommendations should be backed by some kind of evidence or data. If there is none, we can run a test.
        
## Transparency
**Details:**
* Share beliefs, failures, strengths and decisions
* Use transparency to build trust and to help others
* State your thoughts immediately and with honesty
* Over-communicate, repeating things more times than you would intuitively
* Don’t make assumptions, you instead ask that extra question to have the full picture

**In Practice:**
* We've written down and share our [product roadmap publicly](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/projects/2) to make sure that everyone on the team is on the same page, customers can get an idea of what we're working on and potential applicants can get better insight into the projects they may jump into.
* It’s better to let everyone know loud and clear when you’ve made a mistake than for someone else to find out. 

## Hustle
**Details:**
* Are comfortable making decisions and working in situations of uncertainty
* Have a bias towards actions. Done well today is better than perfect next week
* Desire to create a great product!!!
        
**In Practice:**
* If someone in the organization says they will be finished with a task or project by a certain date, they they fully commit to finishing their project by that deadline (or if legitimate delays intrude, advise workers well in advance that the deadline is impossible).
* Where systems are not in place, we create MVP’s and get the first version down as quickly as possible to continue improving our systems. We’ll never have a perfect system without it living in the wild, so the goal is to have this happen as quickly as possible.
