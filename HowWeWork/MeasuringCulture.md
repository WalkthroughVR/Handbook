When it comes to people on the Walkthrough team, we have two main goals as an organization:
1. Recruit & retain top talent. 
2. Create an environment where team members can do their best work.

<br><br>
Our hypothesis on things needed for a team member to do their best work include:
- A positive & transparent environment
- Autonomy 
- Purpose
- Personal Growth

<br><br>
Today, the questions we ask to determine how we’re doing on a scale of 1-10 are:
1. **Do I know what is expected of me at work?** (Do our team members have clear job descriptions, and clarity around projects, tasks and expectations).

2. **Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?** (Do our team members have the resources they need to succeed in their role?)

3. **Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday?** (Do we have people in the right jobs, where they can use and build on their strengths?)

4. **In the last 7 days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?** (When was the last time we gave praise to the individuals in our team?  If it wasn't in the last week, it's not regular enough.  People crave recognition - we should be here to  encourage and cheer-lead our team.)

5. **Does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a person?**  (Do we know who our team members are as people, not employees?)

6.**Is there someone at work who encourages my development?**  (Do we provide opportunities for our staff to learn new skills and feel like they are moving forward?)

7. **At work, do my opinions seem to count? (People leave managers, not jobs.**  What structure do we have in place for our team members to provide their feedback?  And do we listen when it's given?)

8. **Does the mission / purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?**  (Do our team members know how their role fits into the bigger picture?)

9. **Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work**?  (Are we letting poor performers set the standard or are we encouraging people to lift the bar?  The standard we walk past is the standard you set.  Good performers can be demoralised if poor standards are accepted in others.)

10. **Do I have a best friend at work?**  (Are we providing opportunities for our team to grow supportive relationships at work?  Work is a big part of our lives, so it's vital for people to have fun and friendship.)

11. **In the last 6 months, has someone talked to me about my progress?**  (Are we providing regular reviews and feedback to help people with a sense of direction at work?)
**
12. **This last year, have I had the opportunity at work to learn and grow?**  (Are we providing opportunities for advancement?)

13. **How long have you been with Walkthrough?**
    1. <1 month
    2. 1-6 months
    3. 6-12 months
    4. 1-2 years
    5. 2+ years
