At Walkthrough, one of the ways we express our “Transparency” values is by being as open as we can about compensation. This not only includes existing hires but those we aim to attract.

Our hope is that by making our compensation model transparent, we build trust amongst our employees and allow new hires to decide if our opportunity is right for them. Candidates know exactly what they are getting themselves into when they apply and we avoid the awkward negotiation dance at the end of the interview process.

We’re constantly revisiting our model but here it is for now:

## Compensation is calculated by:
Base x Influence x Salary Choice + Benefits

<br><br>
## How our salaries are calculated:
### **Base Salary**
We use Salary.com as well as GlassDoor.com to get an initial salary base for all roles. <br>

<br><br>
### **Influence**
Rather than focus on "experience" or "tenure", we prefer to give our team members much more actionable ways of advancing themselves in the organization.

### **Salary vs Equity Choic**e

- New team members after their first month of employment, have the choice of either choosing more salary or more equity.  [Here an an entire breakdown explaining how equity compensation works.](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/Handbook/blob/master/HowWeWork/ExplainingEquity.md) <br>

- $240/year Learning & Development Stipend - The Learning & Development stipend is available to support teammates’ ongoing self-improvement. This includes: Online courses (Treehouse, Udemy, Coursera, CodeAcademy etc.) Classes, live training (General Assembly, local courses etc.) Leadership coaching, & digital news subscriptions such as the Wall Street Journal and the Economist. It just need to be somewhat work related.

- 2 Weeks minimum vacation - Vacation is always a sticky topic and what we've landed on is a minimum number of days off you should take per year. Often we may work weekends, late night or holidays because thats when we feel the most productive. As long as it doesn't impact your work and what you're able to complete - we want you to take off however much you need. We've never had an issue with someone taking too much time off, rather, we need to encourage people to take more vacation. We really encourage you take at least 2 weeks vacation per year. This policy also covers bereavement leave - take as much time as you need.

- 8 Weeks Maternity Leave w/ Full Pay - You can take as much time as you need thereafter unpaid. Your role will be waiting for you when you come back! You can also choose to take this time before birthy as well.



**Additional Benefits:**
- Buy and/or read any audible or kindle book on the company account.


## **Key Expectations:**
- **Errands** - You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, take a nap, go grocery shopping, doing household chores, helping someone, taking care of a loved one, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected and you have urgent tasks and you're able to communicate, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up any urgent tasks.

- **Vacation** - You do not need to ask permission to take time off. Always make sure that your job responsibilities are covered while you are away. We strongly recommended to take at least a minimum of 2 weeks of vacation per year, if you take less, we might follow up to review your work load.

- **Checking Vacation Calendars** - You do need to ensure that not more than half of the people that can help with availability emergencies (the on-call heroes), regular support, sales, or development are gone at any moment. You can check for this on the availability calendar, so be sure to add appointments early. Add an appointment to the Walkthrough availability calendar (Internal Document) as you know your plans, you can always change it later.

- **Working Hours** - When possible we try to provide team members the flexibility to chose working hours that fit their particular role and circumstances. However, in order to ensure effective collaboration we ask that everyone's normal schedule include availability for meetings and other collaborative work between 9am - 2:00pm Mountain time, Monday through Friday. All standing company meetings will also be scheduled within this time window.

- **Talent vs Travel** - We choose to hire remotely because we want to find the best talent and not be limited by geography. This also provides team members the flexibility to move across the country or even to rotate their home base from time to time without impacting their job. As a caveat, we have found that when team members are constantly traveling while working it can impact your ability to maintain a regular schedule that other team members can depend on. If we believe travel is becoming an issue we will have a conversation about that and address it on a case by case basis.

## What is not included:
* Location - Today we do not adjust salaries based on where a person lives.
* Dependents

<br><br>

## Things we don’t take account of today which we’d like to solve:
* Taxes - For example if you live in a country where taxes are closer to 40-50% of your earnings.
* Exchange rate changes - Because we’re a distributed team, if the exchange rate works in your favor that is obviously a good thing. What happens when the exchange rate drops?
* Loyalty - Should a teammate  with us at Walkthrough, automatically receive a pay raise of 5% every year?
* Management vs Senior level skill

** Thank you to Buffer for being so open about their compensation model which is where we've built the base of our compensation model. **
