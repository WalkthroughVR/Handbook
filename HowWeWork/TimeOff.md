## Errands & Vacation
1. You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, take a nap, go grocery shopping, doing household chores, helping someone, taking care of a loved one, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected and you have urgent tasks and you're able to communicate, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up any urgent tasks.

2. We have an "unlimited" time off policy. This means that:
    * You do not need to ask permission to take time off.
    * Always make sure that your job responsibilities are covered while you are away.
    * We strongly recommended to take at least a minimum of 2 weeks of vacation per year, if you take less, we  might follow up to review your work load.

3. You do need to ensure that not more than half of the people that can help with availability emergencies (the on-call heroes), regular support, sales, or development are gone at any moment. You can check for this on the availability calendar, so be sure to add appointments early. [Add an appointment to the Walkthrough availability calendar](https://github.com/WalkthroughVR/InternalHandbook/blob/master/TimeOff.md) (Internal Document) as you know your plans, you can always change it later.
