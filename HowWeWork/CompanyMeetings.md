At Walkthrough, we are not huge fans of standing meetings. However, as a fully remote team we realized that having a set of standing meetings was critical to effective collaboration. We have come up with the following set of standing meetings that allow us to communicate and collaborate as a team on a regular basis.

# Standing Meetings

Daily Standup - A quick touch base, done primarily through Slack to share learnings, ensure no one is blocked, and provide a quick progress update to the extended Walkthrough team.

Standing Team Lunch (Optional) - An open hangout where anyone can drop in, eat their lunch, or just hang out with other team members. The only rule, no talking shop, schedule your own damn meeting.

Weekly Sprint Planning - A detailed review of the backlog of Engineering and Design tasks with the entire Walkthrough team. We make sure that each task is fully understood and documented (including acceptance criteria) and that every task is estimated and assigned an owner (if it makes sense).

Weekly Growth Meeting - Our weekly opportunity to review our growth objectives, tests that are currently running, and any learnings that have been uncovered.

Weekly Demos - An opportunity to showcase what you have been working on this week or something you would like to show off to your teammates. It is optional to present, but not optional to attend. It can be something work-related or a side project you have been working on in your spare time.

Monthly Open Book (Optional) - This is the chance for the entire company to take a deeper dive into how Walkthrough as a business is performing. We will review month-end financials, metrics, and any other pertinent information or decisions that the board may be discussing. There will be a chance to ask questions of the leadership about any topic.

Monthly Retrospective - The meeting where we get all introspective about how things are going and what we can be doing to improve our execution and our ability to collaborate as a team. We also reflect on whether the retrospective meeting itself is adding value, it sounds very meta, but it is a critical component to continuous improvement.

Monthly Existential Meeting - This is a chance to step out of the day-to-day operations of the business and discuss big meaty topics that often go overlooked. We probably won’t have all the answers (and getting answers isn’t the goal of this meeting), but it is a good forum for people to surface ideas and weigh in on a variety of topics.

Monthly Strategy & Objectives - The meeting where the objectives are set for the next month. Each team then aligns their growth meetings around these objectives.

# Ad Hoc Watercooler Conversation

The meetings above (with the exception of the Standing Team Lunch) are typically structured around getting a piece of business accomplished. To ensure we actually have time to connect with our teammates on a personal level, on a weekly basis we randomly pair two teammates up to schedule their own 1-1 time. These ad hoc conversations give everyone a chance to catch up and hear how things are going outside of work. They also give new people within the team an opportunity to connect with team members when they join and feel more apart of our community.
