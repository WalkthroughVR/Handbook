## Existential - 10:30am-12pm MST every other Friday
Existencial is a meeting for us to connect on any business related topic, not to necissarly achieve consensus, but rather allow everyone to weigh in and receive additional insights on a topic.

Topics may include: 
* I don’t think we should be build X, maybe we should build Y. 
* I’m struggling with building a great customer service team, can we afford to do X?


## Ad Hoc Watercooler Conversation
At Walkthrough, because we're a remote team, when we have emetings with our teammates, they are usually structured around getting a piece of business accomplished. To make sure we actually have time to connect with our teammates on a personal level, on a weekly basis we pair teammates up in the company to schedule their own 1-1 time. On top of that, this also gives new people within the team to have an opportunity to connect with team members when they join and feel more apart of our community.
