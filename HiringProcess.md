# Walkthrough Hiring Process
We’ve outlined our hiring process to not only give candidates the ins and outs to know what we’re looking for but to also give our team a standard process for understanding which candidates would be the best fit for our organization. 

##  Hiring Process Overview
1. Initial survey submission (5 min)
1. Written email submission (30 min)
1. Culture Interview (30 min)
1. 2nd Culture Interview (60 min)
1. Technical Challenge/Interview (1-3 hours)
1. Lightning Talk (45 min)
1. Contract To Hire (1 Month)
1. Full Time Transition 

<br><br>
## Metrics

We’re still in the early days of evaluating our entire hiring funnel but metrics we’re aiming to track are:

- Number of people who make it through the funnel by source
- Number of people who make it through the funnel by position
- Number of days between application & hire

These will be updated as soon as we’re able to get this data together!

<br><br>
## 1) Initial Survey Submission

The key cultural values we’re looking to evaluate are:

- When looking at their social profiles, are they generally positive and optimistic?
- Are they into self/professional development and trying to become the best version of themselves? 
	- As one of our board members [Mike Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-klein-5506b31b/) has mentioned, “it’s not about what they learned but rather do they have the innate desire to be better - like parents who read baby books are better parents because of the curiosity.”
- Have they been in a similar role for most of their career (Not a designer here, engineer there. We want X years of experience from job to job).  

Today, the questions we ask via google form are:

- What is your first name? 
- What is your last name? 
- What is your email (So we can contact you)?
- What is your phone number? 
- What city & country do you currently live in? 
- What role are you applying for? 
- Where did you find this job posting? 
- What is your Linkedin (we look at this instead of Resumes)? 
- What is your facebook URL? 
- What is your twitter URL? 
- What is your Github/Dribbble URL? 
- Do you have any additional website/blog/portfolio? 
- What additional materials, if any, can we provide you upfront to help you decide if applying is worth your time? 
- What are the last 5 books you read and why? 
- What are 3 things you’ve tried or currently do, to improve your productivity/life?  


<br><br>
## 2) Longer Written Submission
Throughout this next part of the process, we're trying to gauge 3 things:

1. How you communicate in the written format (we’re remote so this is our main method of communication) 
1. Understand how you think  
1. Are we in alignment on how to solve problems.   

Below are a few questions that shouldn’t take you longer than 30 minutes to write. If after reading through the responses, we think we’re on the same page, we’ll hop on a video call together.  

Here are the questions we ask you over email:

1. How would you prioritize these upcoming integrations and why?
	1. Building a phone application for realtors to streamline ordering,  
	1. Improve on our photographer phone application to reduce errors by photographers,  
	1. Build a self-onboarding photographer funnel so we eliminate interviews and training overhead) 
1. What are you looking for at Walkthrough that your current company does not provide? 
1.  What is your 2 favorite API documentations and/or UX/UI case studies and why? (Please include a link) 
1. If you were to relate to at least 2 brands that you like, what are those brands and why? (e.g. I most relate to Apple because of their desire to build the best product that is designed with the user in mind throughout the entire process. I most relate to Buffer for their never ending quest for bettering themselves and their transparency. I like that because…) 
1.  What are 3 technical questions that we should ask you in the video interview that would allow us to get a great understanding of your expertise and how you might have a deeper level of knowledge than other candidates?  


<br><br>
## 3) First Cultural Interview
The idea of the first interview is to understand if we’re an initial fit. We may not cover every question but we should both walk away from the conversation thinking *“Yes - I’d love to continue talking to this company/candidate.”*

From our perspective, throughout the first interview the key things we’re looking to evaluate are:

- Did we struggle carrying the conversation or was it very natural?
- How hungry are they? Is this just another job or are they really engaged, trying to read as much as they can?
- Do they want to be apart of a company with a high growth trajectory? Are they looking for stability in one particular role? Are they looking at how much they could grow personally or professionally?
- Is this person innately curious and trying to become a better person? Constantly trying to learn, are humble enough to know they can constantly improve?
- Do they think about work in their off-time as a hobby? (Contribute to Github on personal projects, Dribbble as redesigns, etc)
- Does this person eat/sleep/breath their profession?  


The questions we ask in the first interview in no particular order are: 

- How did you prepare for this interview?
- What attracted you to this role?
- Why are you looking to make a switch now vs 6 months ago?
- What are the next 3 books you’re looking to read?
- What book would you recommend everyone in our startup read & why?
- How are you deciding between companies to work with?
- What does success look like for you in this role? What do you think would make you feel happy or fulfilled working here for the next several years?  





<br><br>
## 4) Follow Up Cultural Interview
The idea of the second interview is more of an extension of our first call. Here we may cover the questions we missed in our first interaction and we should be covering additional questions each other have. 




<br><br>
## 5) Technical Challenge/Interview
To be added

<br><br>
## 6) Lightning Talk
Throughout the lightning talk, the key things we’re looking to evaluate are:

- Do they pull the energy out of the room or do they add to it? 
- Are they able to teach the rest of the team something new? 
- Do we feel as if they are raising the expertise level of the team? 
- Does the existing team enjoy interacting with them? 


#### What makes a good lightning talk: 
- Deep expertise: 
	- You look intelligent if we all walk away from the talk thinking, wow, I didn’t know that. Telling us what design is - makes you look like a beginner. Telling us use cases for design that we’ve never thought of before - that makes you look like you know the ins & outs of design.  
	
#### Things to avoid during your talk: 

- Reading from your screen: 
	- Your slides should help convey your points, not be used to keep you on track.   
- Presenting for more than 5 minutes: 
	- The lightning talk is designed for us to interact with you. When you take 10-20 minutes it not only shows that you weren’t prepared and didn’t plan well, but it also doesn’t let us talk to you.   
- Filler words: 
	- This makes us believe that you don’t know what you’re talking about. We’re a remote company and we can’t see your body language. Using filler words doesn’t display confidence so be sure that you know your topic well.  

#### Just to get your mind going, here are a couple ideas as examples: 

- The pros & cons of using Python over PHP. 
- How Apple & Slack vary in their design process and why it works for them. 
- The underlying reasons why people or companies who do X are more successful.

## 7) Homework and/or Independent Contract Period
To be added.


<br><br>
## What is not taken into account throughout the interview process as of now:
- Role specific interviews
- Potentially adding personality tests (DISC, Enneagram, Myers Briggs, etc)
- When do we review the financial model w/ candidates & does that have an impact in the hiring process?
- How do we, if at all, gauge their ability to work remotely?
- Being more clear about exact compensation someone may receive when joining Walkthrough before applying.
